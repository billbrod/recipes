# Brief references

Short things that I often refer back to.

## Recipes

- Roasted beets (from Food Lab): roast at 375F in aluminum foil packets (roughly
  1lb per packet), with .5 Tbsp oil, 2 sprigs herbs, and some salt and pepper in
  each packet. Roast until a cake tester goes through without any resistance,
  about 1 hour, then carefully open packet and let cool for 30 minutes. Peel
  under cold running water.
  - Note that covering hands in oil will reduce the amount of pigment that gets
    on hands from beets (from Flavor Equation).
- Iced tea (from [Serious
  Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/cold-brewed-iced-tea-recipe)): 4 tea bags /
  1 Tbsp loose leaf tea per quart of water, in fridge for 5 hours.
- Vinaigrette (from Food Lab): 
    - 1 part acid 
    - 1/3 part emulsifier (mustard, honey, mayo, egg yolk)
    - 2-3 parts neutral oil 
    - up to 1 part flavored oil (extra virgin olive oil, nut oils, toasted sesame
      oil)
    - about 1/2 to 1 part other flavorings: minced shallots, garlic, herbs, ground
      spices, mashed anchovies, toasted and crushed nuts
- Pasta water (from [Serious
  Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-salty-should-pasta-water-be)): 1 Tbsp
  Diamond Crystal kosher salt per liter of water
- Steamed eggs (from [Serious
  Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/steamed-hard-boiled-eggs-recipe)): add 1
  inch water to large pot, with steamer insert above it. bring to boil over high
  heat, then add eggs to steamer and cover. Cook for 6 minutes for soft-boiled
  and 12 minutes for hard-boiled. place immediately in ice bath and allow to
  cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under running water.
- Tamarind paste (from
  [NYTimes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021264-tamarind-paste)): 9 oz
  tamarind pulp (from compressed block) to 1.5 cups boiling water. Separate
  tamarind into small chunks and place into medium heatproof bowl. Pour boiling
  water over tamarind, submerge completely, cover with plastic wrap and let sit
  for 3o to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. As water cools, rub fruit between
  fingers to separate it from seeds. The mixture will turn thick and pulpy. Set
  fine mesh sieve over medium bowl and pass mixture through to remove fibrous
  materials and seeds, pressing firmly with large spoon to squeeze out as much
  liquid as possible. Transfer to clean container and store in fridge for up to 2 months.

## Bean cooking times

- 1lb of dry beans: 5 to 6 cups cooked beans plus 2 to 3 cups liquid
- 1 can of beans: 1.5 to 1.75 cups cooked beans plus .5 to .75 cups liquid
- 1lb of dry beans: 3 to 4 cans of beans

From Cool Beans and [this

which seems to be from an unaffiliated facebook group but has the Rancho Gordo
marketing on it.

The following is for instant pot cooking time, all with natural pressure
release.

For cooking beans in pressure cooker:

- don't soak
- add 3 cups of water for every 1 cup of dried beans
- 1 Tbsp salt per lb of dried beans
- for every lb: .5 onion, few garlic cloves, bay leaf or two, maybe some kombu
