## Description

Earlier this week, summer was holding its ground here in Seattle, with one last burst of sunny skies and warm weather. Now, the change is evident: the leaves are starting to turn and the mornings are more crisp. Autumn is preparing for its close-up.

I'm all about drinking seasonally, and as autumn begins, I find myself with a growing taste for apple brandy, a spirit that deserves a greater share of the mixological spotlight.

The Supreme is a cocktail that shows off the spirit's abilities: crisp with citrus and with the ethereal nuttiness of orgeat, a French almond syrup usually laced with orange flower water. The Supreme promotes the rich and fruity flavor of apple brandy to a well-deserved starring role. It's a great drink to enjoy while watching autumn's debut.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 2 ounces apple brandy
- .5 ounce lemon or lime juice (I prefer lime)
- .25 ounce orgeat
- Dash of real pomegranate grenadine

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake well for 10 seconds and strain into chilled cocktail glass.
