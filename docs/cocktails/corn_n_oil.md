## Description

This drink is a classic combo of Caribbean flavors—the spice of falernum, bitters, lime and molasses-rich rum—making it similar to a Dark ’n’ Stormy, sans the spicy kick of ginger. The recipe varies depending on geographic preferences: American versions go heavy on rum, while the Barbadian blueprint specifies a heavier hand with the Velvet Falernum. Either way, we like lots of bitters per Brad Thomas Parsons’ recommendation in Bitters.

## Summary 

<!-- put a brief summary of ingredients and ratios here, which will get summarized on index, e.g., for martini, 2:1 gin:vermouth -->

- 2:.5:.5 dark rum:falernum:lime

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- .5 ounce Velvet Falernum

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

## Comments

- 2024-05-02: Lot of discussion in [this article](https://punchdrink.com/articles/what-is-blackstrap-rum-anyway/) on what blackstrap rum actually is. Turns out, it's unclear. I think I originally made this drink using Cruzan Blackstrap rum, try and experiment to see what works.
