## Description

This individually-sized Scorpion was adapted by Jeff Berry and Annene Kaye for Beachbum Berry's Grog Log based on an original drink by Trader Vic from the 1950s. We can't get enough: it's tart and fresh, lightly sweet, and nicely spiked with a mixture of light Puerto Rican rum and brandy. Have fun with the garnishes: throw on the edible flowers, pineapple wedges, cherries, limes, lemons...or make a huge batch and serve it in a Scorpion or flaming Volcano bowl with lots of straws.

- .5 ounce orgeat syrup

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Put all ingredients in a blender and blend for 10 seconds. Pour unstrained into a double old fashioned glass or wide brandy snifter. Garnish as desired.
