## Description

 Created by San Francisco bartender Marcovaldo Dionysos, the Chartreuse Swizzle takes the basic elements of a Caribbean swizzle and sends them to grad school. By swapping the rum for green Chartreuse--a French herbal liqueur with a recipe dating back centuries--the Chartreuse Swizzle takes a simple summer cooler and turns the complexity level up to the proverbial eleven. The mixture may seem odd but in the glass, it works wonders. If you're looking for a unique and stunning drink to cool off with this August weekend, the Chartreuse Swizzle would be a good place to start. 

## Summary 

<!-- put a brief summary of ingredients and ratios here, which will get summarized on index, e.g., for martini, 2:1 gin:vermouth -->

{ #summary }

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 1.25 ounces green Chartreuse
- 1 ounce pineapple juice
- .75 ounce lime juice
- .5 ounce falernum*

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Combine ingredients in a Collins glass and fill with crushed ice. Swizzle with a bar spoon or swizzle stick until the outside of the glass frosts, adding more crushed ice as needed. Serve with a straw and a satisfied expression.
