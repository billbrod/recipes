## Description

A Trader Vic original, the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club is Vic’s tiki-fied version of the Daiquiri. Instead of one-dimensional simple syrup, Vic substituted orange curaçao and spiced falernum to intensify the tropical flavors and presumably translate the feeling of a Caribbean port-of-call.

## Summary 

<!-- put a brief summary of ingredients and ratios here, which will get summarized on index, e.g., for martini, 2:1 gin:vermouth -->

- rum, falernum, curacao, lime
{ #summary }

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

Two variants here:

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
### Punch 
- 2 ounces rum (preferably El Dorado 5 Year)
- .5 ounce falernum
- .25 ounce orange curacao (preferably Pierre Ferrand)
- .74 ounce lime juice 

### Serious Eats
- 2 ounces Barbados rum (Mount Gay and Cockspur are common, and good, brands)
- .75 ounce fresh lime juice
- 2 dashes Cointreau
- 2 teaspoons falernum*

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Add ingredients to cocktail shaker and shake until chilled, then strain into chilled coupe glass and garnish with lime wheel
