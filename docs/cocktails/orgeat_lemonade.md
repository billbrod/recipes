{ #summary }

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 1 ounce fresh lemon juice from 1 lemon
- 2 ounces orgeat (or to taste)
- 3 ounces water
- Lemon peel or fresh herb sprig to garnish (optional)

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Add lemon juice, orgeat, and water to a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake until well chilled, about 15 seconds. Strain into a highball glass over crushed ice. Garnish with lemon peel or fresh herbs if desired.
