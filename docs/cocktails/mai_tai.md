## Description

The credit for this iconic 1940s drink—whose name is a nod to the Tahitian, “Maita’i,” which means “good”—is usually given to venerable Los Angeles tiki bar Trader Vic’s. Buoyed by the rise of tiki culture and some big celebrity endorsements (think Elvis in Blue Hawaii), this rum-based umbrella drink became cemented in the public imagination as a tropical must-have. The classic components of tiki are all here: lots of rum, a citrus component and a hint of exotica via the addition of orgeat, a syrup made from almonds. But don’t look to this drink for kitsch factor alone: when done up right—no orange juice or syrupy prefab Mai Tai mix—this is one of the greats. This version—a recipe interpreted by tiki bartender Brian Miller—is based on Trader Vic’s 1944 original. (It’s pictured in a Mai Tai glass from Alan Smart’s Los Angeles home tiki bar, HaleKahiki.)

## Comments

- 2024-05-02: looking at other variants of this, they always call for 2 oz of rum, typically dark, so could play around with that. [This article](https://www.seriouseats.com/tiki-cocktail-history-basics-of-tiki-drinks-essential-ingredients) says the original Mai Tai calls for 17-year Wray & Nephew rum, which is no longer available, and says that Jeff Beachbum Berry suggests a blend of Rhum Clement VSOP Martinique rum and Appleton Estate Extra 12-year-old dark Jamaican rum.
