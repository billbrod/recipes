## Description
I don't know who Cameron was, or why he might want to be kicking. But I do know that this unlikely union of ingredients makes one of the most startlingly appealing drinks in the bartender's vintage-cocktail arsenal.

Scotch whisky is a notoriously difficult ingredient to use in cocktails; Irish whiskey isn't much better. Introduce them into the same glass, though, with some lemon juice for brightness and the ethereal character of orgeat for sweetness, and they get along as nice as can be. This cocktail dates back to at least 1930; that's when it crops up in a slim book called Cocktails, by "Jimmy" late of Ciro's (it also appears in the Savoy Cocktail Book at about the same time). It's too unlikely a bird to ever have enjoyed widespread fame; but its idiosyncrasies are the very things that make it so appealing. 

## Summary

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 1 ounce blended Scotch whisky
- 1 ounce Irish whiskey
- .5 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice
- .5 ounce orgeat

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Pour ingredients into a cocktail shaker; fill with ice and shake well for 10 seconds. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
