- Swiffer solution: equal parts water and vinegar, 1-2 drops dish soap, couple
  drops of essential oil (from [here](https://helloglow.co/diy-swiffer-pads/))

- Diaper wipe solution: most reddit threads recommend just using water in a
  spray bottle. One
  [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/clothdiaps/comments/vqqh5k/wipe_solution/)
  suggested using a couple drops of oil to remove really sticky / partially
  dried ones as needed.
- Diaper cream: Mt Sinai video said no need to use cream for routine diaper
  changes, but if they get rash can use white zinc oxide cream (should be plant
  oil-based to make cleaning diaper easier). can make own by buying powder (up
  to 40% zinc oxide by weight), but apparently hard to clean if used in pot.
