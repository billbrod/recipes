### Diapers

- Diaper wipe solution: most reddit threads recommend just using water in a
  spray bottle. One
  [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/clothdiaps/comments/vqqh5k/wipe_solution/)
  suggested using a couple drops of oil to remove really sticky / partially
  dried ones as needed.
- Diaper cream: Mt Sinai video said no need to use cream for routine diaper
  changes, but if they get rash can use white zinc oxide cream (should be plant
  oil-based to make cleaning diaper easier). can make own by buying powder (up
  to 40% zinc oxide by weight), but apparently hard to clean if used in pot.
- Diaper pail (from [diaperkind](https://www.diaperkind.com/how-it-works/your-diaper-pail-and-bag/)):

  - can put Tbsp baking soda in bottom of pail for extra smell help
  - if pail smells while open, change the deo-disk (~4-6 weeks)
  - if pail smells while closed, change carbon filter (~3-4 weeks)
  - time between changes vary based on season, temperature, and humidity
- diaper basics (from [diaperkind](https://www.diaperkind.com/how-it-works/how-often-do-i-change-my-baby/)):

  - change baby with every feeding or whenever you detect poop
  - you do not need to wake a sleeping baby to change them
  - it's okay to leave a pee-diaper until next feeding
