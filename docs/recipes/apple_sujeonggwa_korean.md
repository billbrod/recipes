# Apple Sujeonggwa (Korean Cinnamon-Ginger Punch)

- Serves: 4
{ #serves }
- Time: 45 minutes
- Date added: 2023-08-26

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

- 5 cinnamon sticks
- 6 cups (1.4L) water
- 7 ounces dark brown sugar (about 1 cup, packed; 200g)
- 8 whole cloves
- 2 star anise pods
- 6 ounces fresh ginger (about 3 three-inch pieces; 170g), peeled and thinly sliced
- 3 ounces dried apple chips (about 1.5 cups; 85g)
- 3 tablespoons (30g) pine nuts

## Directions

1. Using tongs and working one at a time, lightly char cinnamon sticks by holding them over open flame of a gas burner or kitchen torch until lightly singed on both sides, 15 to 30 seconds each. Alternatively, if you don't have a gas burner, char cinnamon sticks in a dry cast iron skillet over high heat, about 10 minutes.
2. In a 3-quart saucepan, combine charred cinnamon sticks, water, brown sugar, cloves, star anise, and ginger. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula to help brown sugar dissolve, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture is intensely aromatic and sugar is fully dissolved, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in apple chips, cover, and set aside to steep for 20 minutes.
3. Strain punch through a fine-mesh strainer, gently pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. If serving right away, return punch to saucepan and reheat over low heat until warmed through. Divide punch between individual mugs, sprinkle with pine nuts, and serve. If making tea in advance, allow to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days; reheat over low heat before serving.

## Notes

Sujeonggwa is normally made with dried persimmons, which are hard to find. They replace them with dried apple chips and charring the cinnamon sticks.
