## Description
I love the simplicity of this dish. You only need one pot, and everything is cooked together, ensuring that all the flavours mingle cohesively. It's inspired by the flavours and cooking method of Japanese corn rice, where rice is cooked alongside corn and seasoned with soy sauce and butter. I've riffed on this idea and applied the same principle to pasta.
### Tips:
- Keep the corn cobs and add them to the pot as you cook the pasta. This not only minimises wasted flavour but maximises the "corniness" of this dish.
- Using frozen or canned corn: I like using fresh corn so we can use the cobs for extra flavour, but you can also use frozen or even canned corn — you'll need about 300-400 grams of corn kernels.
- The sake is optional, but it adds extra umami and sweetness. If you don't have sake, mirin is an acceptable substitute but bear in mind that it is sweeter so take that into account when seasoning. If you choose to go without sake (or mirin), just an extra ¼ cup of water.
- Make this dish vegan by using dairy-free butter.
- There is also flexibility in the seasonings. If you want to go extra luxurious, add another tablespoon (or two, if you dare) of butter. Want more umami? Drizzle some more soy sauce over the top when you are ready to eat. You can also reduce the amount of soy sauce if you want a more mellow dish.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- 4 cobs of corn (about 600-650g), husks removed. (Or 300-400g frozen or tinned corn kernels, see tips above)
- 60ml (.25 cup) sake or water (See tips above for using mirin in place of sake, which is optional)
- 60ml (.25 cup) soy sauce or tamari
- 500g short pasta such as shells
- 1 Tablespoon white miso paste
- 3-4 Tablespoon regular or vegan butter
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 spring onions, finely sliced

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Place the corn on one side of a chopping board and, using a sharp knife, slice off the kernels. You should get about 300-350 grams of corn, but this will vary depending upon the size of your cob so a little less or more is fine.
2. In a large jug, add 875ml (3.5 cups) of water along with the sake (if using, or an extra 60ml or ¼ cup of water if not) and the soy sauce or tamari.
3. Pour the pasta into a large Dutch oven or pot. Cover with the sake-soy sauce liquid, scatter over the corn and top with the corn cobs. Place over medium high heat and bring to a simmer. Cover with lid and then reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 minutes, until the pasta is al dente and most of the liquid has been absorbed — you want some starchy water left in the pan (some brands of pasta will take longer so taste the pasta as you go to make sure it is cooked to your liking).
4. Remove the corn cobs and discard. Reduce the heat to low, add the miso paste and butter and stir well to ensure that the miso melts into the pasta. Cook on low heat for 1-2 minutes, uncovered, just until the remaining starchy water melds with the miso and butter to form a creamy coating for the pasta. Taste and season with more black pepper if you like. Top with spring onions and serve immediately.
