## Ingredients { #ingredients }

- 1 md head green cabbage (about 2 pounds)
- 1 lg yellow onion (about 8 ounces), sliced thick
- 1 lg carrot, cut into .25-inch rounds
- .25 c chicken stock, vegetable stock, or water
- .25 c extra-virgin olive oil
- Coarse salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Crushed red pepper flakes
- Flaky salt (optional)

Cabbage heads come in a range of sizes. If yours weighs more than 2 pounds—check your grocery receipt for its weight if you don’t have a kitchen scale—lob off part of it and use that portion for another purpose. This approach is a tip from the original author of this recipe. That is how thorough Molly Stevens is with her recipe-writing. If you don’t have a carrot on hand, leave it out. The recipe is better with it, but I have made a great version without a carrot.

## Directions

1. Set one oven rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat the oven to 325℉.
2. Trim the cabbage head of bruised or discolored outer leaves. Cut the cabbage through the core into 8 wedges. Arrange the wedges in a large baking dish, such as a 9-by-13 dish. (Or in two 8-by-8 square baking dishes, if that is all you happen to have.) The wedges may overlap a bit, but your goal is to lay them in a single layer.
3. Scatter the onion and carrot across the dish. Drizzle over the stock or water and the oil. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cover tightly with foil, set on the middle rack and cook until the vegetables are completely tender, about 2 hours total. After the first hour or so, turn the cabbage wedges with tongs. If the wedges fall apart, that’s just fine. If the dish begins to dry out, add a tablespoon or two of water.
4. When the cabbage is completely tender, discard the foil, increase the heat to 400℉, and roast until the vegetables begin to brown, another 15 minutes or so. Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with flaky salt, if you like. Should you have leftovers, they are even tastier the next day. Eat at room temperature or reheat for 20 minutes in a moderate oven.
