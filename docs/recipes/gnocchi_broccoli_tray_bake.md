## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 1 large broccoli (about 500 g)
- 1 kg (about 2 packs) dried gnocchi
- 1 Tbsp fennel seeds
- 2 lemons, 1 sliced and 1 halved
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 50 g pecorino, grated
- Handful of parsley, leaves torn
- Sea salt and black pepper

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Preheat the oven to 220Â°C (430F).
2. Cut the broccoli into florets. Trim the woody exterior off the stalk and cut into chunks similar in size to the florets. Open the packets of gnocchi and separate them well (they tend to stick together). Combine the broccoli in a large bowl, along with the gnocchi, fennel seeds, sliced lemon, garlic and drizzle everything with a good amount of olive oil. Season well with sea salt and black pepper, and toss to combine and coat everything well.
3. Tip the gnocchi and broccoli onto a 2 large baking trays, making sure that everything is in a single layer, and roast for 15-20 minutes, until gnocchi are golden and the broccoli and lemon are caramelised. Remove from the oven and toss everything together. The flavour of the charred lemon will coat the gnocchi and broccoli.
4. To serve, place the trays in the middle of the table and top with a drizzle of olive oil, pecorino and 1-2 teaspoons (or to your taste) of black pepper. To serve, top with parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

- 2024-05-04: this was delicious! seemed like a lot of cheese relative to the amount of everything else. I made it with preserved lemons for the bake instead of regular, and that worked well
