## Description
Crisp cucumber and tender eggs are stir fried with simple seasonings and aromatics, elevated by dried lily flowers and wood ear mushrooms for texture. I want to share this family recipe that makes a vegetable dish so satisfying.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- 1 handful dried lily flowers , yields 1 and 1/2 cups after rehydration 
- 12 pieces dried wood ear mushrooms , yields 1 cup after rehydration 
- 3 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable oil) 
- 3 big eggs , beaten with 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cloves garlic , minced
- 1 scallion , thinly sliced, white and light green parts separated
- 1 small carrot , sliced into diamond shape 
- 1 Chinese or English cucumber , sliced into diamonds 
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Place lily flowers and wood ear mushrooms into two separate medium-sized bowls, and add warm water to cover. Let rehydrate until turning tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Gently rinse off any dirt on the surface and drain. Snip off the tough ends from the lily flowers, if needed. Halve them if too long. Cut the wood ear mushrooms into bite-size pieces. Gently pat dry with paper towels.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet or wok until hot. Add egg and scramble it. Let the eggs cook until some of the surface has turned golden brown. Transfer to a plate.
3. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the garlic and scallion whites. Stir a few times until fragrant.
4. Add lily flowers, wood ear mushrooms and carrot. Cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, until the carrot starts to turn tender.
5. Add cucumber. Swirl in soy sauce and sugar. Sprinkle with chicken bouillon. Immediately stir to mix well.
6. Return cooked egg to the skillet and stir to mix well. Taste the dish and sprinkle with extra salt if needed. Continue stirring until all the ingredients are mixed well.
7. Turn off heat. Swirl in the sesame oil and stir to mix well. Serve hot over steamed rice as a main dish or as a side dish.
