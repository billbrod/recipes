## Description

Saag paneer is a classic North Indian dish — but it’s also endlessly riffable. Swap out the paneer for feta or halloumi, the mustard greens for kale or spinach, and so on. This is a particularly stellar riff, in which coconut milk enriches an already aromatic and verdant sauce that can be paired with either the traditional paneer, or extra-firm tofu. The final hit of coconut oil infused with smoky cumin seeds and red chile powder adds loads of depth, making this dish quite possibly the most luxurious way to eat a pound of greens.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
- 3 green cardamom pods or ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom (freshly ground is best)
- 1 small yellow onion, roughly chopped
- 1 (½-inch) piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 pound mustard greens, tough ends trimmed and greens roughly chopped, or fresh baby spinach (10 to 12 cups)
- .5 lime, juiced
- 1 small Indian green chile, serrano chile or Thai bird’s-eye chile, roughly chopped
- 1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt (such as Morton)
- 1 (13-ounce) can coconut milk
- 1 (12-ounce) block extra-firm tofu or 1 (8-ounce) package paneer, cut into ½-inch cubes
- 1.5 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
- .25 teaspoon asafetida (optional, but really fantastic)
- .25 teaspoon red chile powder, such as cayenne or Kashmiri
- R ice or roti, for serving

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. In a large, deep pan or Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the vegetable oil. Once it shimmers, add the coriander and cardamom and toast the spices until fragrant and starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.
2. Add the mustard greens, a large handful at a time, and cook until just wilted and still bright green. Don’t overcook the greens!
3. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lime juice, chile and salt. Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and blend into a chunky paste. Return the mixture to the same pan over low heat. Stir in the coconut milk, then gently stir in tofu. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes more, until the tofu is warmed through and has soaked up some of the sauce.
4. While the tofu cooks, in a small pan or butter warmer over medium-high heat, melt the coconut oil. Add the cumin seeds, and once they start to brown and dance around in the pan, about 1 minute, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the asafetida, if using, and red chile powder.
5. Pour the coconut oil mixture over the saag, and serve with rice or roti.
