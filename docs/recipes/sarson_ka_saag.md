## Description
Buttery, creamy, and nutritious mustard greens cooked with fresh aromatics, this Punjabi-style Sarson ka Saag is a winter staple from the northern-Indian region. This authentic family recipe for spiced, pureed greens is best paired with a cornmeal flatbread called [makki ki roti](makka_ki_roti.md).

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 1 tablespoon ghee or olive oil for vegan
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 serrano chilies
- 1 inch ginger roughly chopped
- 6 cloves garlic roughly chopped
- 1 medium red onion coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt adjust to taste
- .25 turmeric powder optional
- 2-3 teaspoons coriander powder
- 1.5 garam masala
- .5 red chili powder adjust to taste
- .75 cup water divided
- 2 bunches Sarson (Mustard Greens)
- 1 bunch spinach
- 4 pink radish trimmed, cut in quarters
- 2 tablespoons corn meal (makki ka atta) see notes for substitute

### Optional Tempering

- 2 teaspoons ghee
- 1 clove garlic thinly sliced
- .25 red chili powder

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Prepare the greens: Trim the fibrous stems of the mustard greens then roughly chop the leaves and light green stems. Follow the same with spinach leaves. Now combine the two and rinse them thoroughly, 2 to 3 times to wash away any dirt.
2. Saute aromatics: Turn on the instant pot and select saute. Add ghee and cumin seeds. Wait for cumin to sizzle then add onion, ginger, garlic, and serrano chilies. Saute for 3 minutes till the onions turn translucent.
3. Season and saute: Add salt, spices, and ¼ cup of water. Saute for 30 seconds to cook the spices. Cancel saute.
4. Add greens and pressure cook: Add the rinsed and drained greens, chopped radish, and ½ cup of water. Skip the stirring, close the lid, and set the valve to sealing. Pressure cook for 4 minutes at high pressure.
5. Release pressure, puree saag: When the cooking time is up, release the pressure manually and open the lid when the pin drops. Using an immersion blender, puree the saag coarsely.
6. Simmer with cornmeal (makki ka atta): Turn on saute. When the saag begins simmering, stir in cornmeal and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Cancel saute.
7. Optional step - Prepare tadka (tempering): I add a simple ghee tempering called 'tadka' to elevate the taste of saag. Heat ghee in a small pan, and add sliced garlic and red chili powder. When the garlic starts sizzling, turn off the heat so it doesn't burn.
8. Serve & enjoy: Transfer the sarson ka saag to a bowl and top it with hot tadka before serving. Enjoy it with freshly made makki ki roti for a complete Punjabi meal.
