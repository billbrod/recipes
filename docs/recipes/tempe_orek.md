## Ingredients { #ingredients }

- 8 ounces tempe, cut into 2-inch-long and .25-inch thick matchsticks
- 5 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- .25 cup sliced shallots or red onion
- 2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 (.5-inch) piece galangal, sliced into .125-inch-thick pieces
- 1 lemongrass bulb, smashed
- 3 makrut lime leaves, stems removed and leaves cut into thin strips
- 2 teaspoons sambal oelek
- 3 tablespoons tamarind extract (see note below)
- 3 tablespoons coconut palm sugar or light brown sugar
- .25 teaspoon fine sea salt
- Water

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (convection) or 425°F (non-convection). (If using an air-fryer, which you can, preheat to 390°F).
2. Toss the tempe with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Spread in an even layer on a foil-lined baking tray. Roast until golden brown, about 20 minutes. If not using convection, flip over the tempe halfway. If using an air fryer, cook for 15 minutes.
3. Stir-fry the shallots and garlic in the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4. Add the galangal, lemongrass, and lime leaves. Add the sambal oelek and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
5. Add the tamarind, coconut sugar, salt, and 1 tablespoon of water. Cook until the sugar melts and a sticky sauce forms.
6. Add the tempe and stir until coated, adding 1 tablespoon of water at a time if necessary. Taste and add more seasonings, if desired. You want a combination of sweet, spicy, and sour flavors.
7. Serve immediately with white rice.
