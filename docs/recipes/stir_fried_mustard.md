## Description
Fresh Chinese mustard greens make a great stir fried vegetable dish. For this Chinese mustard greens recipe, we used what is called in Chinese, xuelihong (雪里红) which you can find at your local Chinese supermarket.
## Ingredients { #ingredients }
- 4 cloves garlic (smashed and chopped)
- A small handful of dried red chili peppers (de-seeded and cut)
- 1.25 mustard greens (550g, thoroughly washed and cut into 1 cm long pieces)
- 1.5 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- Salt to taste
- .5 teaspoon organic chicken bouillon (optional)

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Heat the oil oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the garlic and chili peppers and cook for about a minute, being sure to avoid burning the garlic.
2. Now add the mustard greens, turning the heat up to the highest setting. Add the sugar, sesame oil, and salt (and organic chicken bouillon if using). Stir and mix everything well.
3. Cover the lid, and let it cook for about 45 seconds to a minute. Now uncover, stirring the greens one more time. Plate and serve immediately!

## Notes

- I do want to point out that cooking leafy greens requires a lot of oil. Please don’t be alarmed when you see how much oil I used for this recipe, which, in a way, I still think was not quite enough if you’re really looking for that restaurant finish.
