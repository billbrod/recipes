## Description

Clafoutis, a pudding from the Limousin region of France, is usually made with cherries but often with other fruit, such as berries, apples, or pears. This silky pudding also works well as a savory dish, with tangy tomatoes at the helm. I’ve used Gruyere here as I love its nutty overtones and rich creaminess, but you could also use other cheeses that melt well, such as Comte, fontina, Gouda or brie. Take this tomato dish in another direction by adding some wilted greens (spinach or kale) and feta. It’s a fun recipe to experiment with. Tomatoes release a lot of liquid when baked so it’s important to let the clafoutis rest when it comes out of the oven, which allows everything to settle and come together.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 700g (1.5 pounds) cherry or grape tomatoes
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- sea salt and black pepper
- 2–3 thyme sprigs, leaves picked
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- .66 (160 ml) regular whole milk or oat milk
- 2 eggs
- 50g (6.5 tablespoons) all-purpose or gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 120g (4.25 ounces Gruyere, freshly grated
- handful of sliced chives or green onions

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F / 180˚C. You will need a baking dish or ovenproof skillet that is about 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter (I use a cast-iron skillet, but a rectangular baking dish works, too). Drizzle with 1–2 tablespoons of olive oil and tilt the dish or pan so the oil lightly coats the base and sides.
2. Place the tomatoes in a large bowl, along with the garlic, 1 teaspoon of sea salt, the thyme leaves, vinegar and sugar. Using clean hands, squeeze the tomatoes until they burst, just enough to allow some of the juices to flow out. Tip this mixture into the prepared dish or pan, and keep the bowl to use again at the next step.
3. Add the milk and eggs to the bowl and whisk until well combined. Add the flour, Gruyere, about 1 teaspoon of sea salt and a few turns of freshly ground black pepper. Whisk until well combined (some lumps are okay).
4. Pour the batter over the tomatoes and give the dish or pan a shake so it can settle among the tomatoes. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 35–40 minutes, until the center is just set, with a slight wobble. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10–15 minutes before serving—this is important as it allows everything to meld together. Serve topped with the chives or green onion.
