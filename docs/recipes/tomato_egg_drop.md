## Description
This easy, simple tomato egg drop soup is a great addition to any meal.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 10 ounces tomatoes  (1 large or 2 small, cut into small chunks)
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 2 cups water (or more chicken stock)
- 2 teaspoons light soy sauce
- .5 teaspoon sesame oil
- .25 teaspoon white pepper
- salt (to taste)
- 1 egg (beaten)
- 1.5 teaspoons cornstarch (mixed with 2 tablespoons/30ml water)
- 1 scallion (finely chopped)
- 2 tablespoons cilantro (chopped, optional)

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Heat the oil in a soup pot or wok over medium low heat. Add the tomato chunks and stir-fry for 5 minutes until the tomatoes are softened and start to fall apart.
2. Add in 1 cup chicken stock, 2 cups water, 2 teaspoons light soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, and then lower the heat so that the soup is simmering with the lid on.
3. Now quickly beat the egg in a small bowl and prepare the cornstarch slurry in a separate bowl.
4. Use a ladle to slowly swirl the soup in a whirlpool motion. Keep swirling as you pour in the cornstarch slurry until well incorporated. Now pour a thin stream of egg into the middle of the whirlpool as you slowly swirl the soup. This is how you get that pretty egg drop effect.
5. Serve hot or at room temperature. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with chopped scallions and cilantro, if using.
