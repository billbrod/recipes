## Description
Soy sauce fried rice is simple yet indulgent. It is a classic Chinese dish that uses minimal ingredients to create maximum flavor. Only takes ten minutes to prepare, and it’s robust enough to serve as a main or to satisfy your midnight salty snack craving.

Jasmine rice is my favorite type of rice for soy sauce fried rice, because it has a nice fragrance, and the grains separate easily during cooking. You can also use other type of medium grain white rice for this recipe. I do not recommend using short grain rice, because it is starchier and the grains won’t crisp up nicely. For a healthier option, you can also use medium grain brown rice instead of white rice.

Overnight rice is not the most precise description. The best rice is 2 to 3 days old.

Freshly cooked rice contains a lot of moisture and its texture is sticky. It tastes great served as-is, but it won’t create the best result for fried rice.

When the rice is a few days old, it will start to get quite dry. You can easily separate the grains using your fingers without it feeling sticky. It is the best rice for frying, to get that crunchy crispy texture. Sometimes I freeze the rice and then thaw it, to achieve the desired texture for fried rice.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- .125 teaspoon white pepper powder
- 3 tablespoons butter or schmaltz
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 4 cups overnight jasmine rice (or other medium grain rice)
- 3 green onions , chopped
- Salt to taste
## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Combine the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
2. Add the butter into a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high heat until melted. Add the eggs. Cook until the bottom is slightly set. Scramble until the eggs are mostly cooked.
3. Add the rice onto the egg. Cook and chop the rice with your spatula, to separate the grains and coat the rice with egg. Cook until the heat builds up and you can hear a vibrant sizzling.
4. Swirl in the soy sauce mixture. Cook and stir constantly, until the rice turns an even color.
5. Add the green onion and stir to mix well.
6. Carefully taste the rice. Season lightly with sea salt if needed. Stir and mix thoroughly, so the salt is evenly dispersed.
7. Transfer the rice to a bowl and serve hot as a side or a light main dish.
