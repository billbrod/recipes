# Beans Marbella

- Date added: 2023-08-27

NOTE: now a formal recipe on [NYTimes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023274-beans-marbella)

Simmer dried beans with bay leaves and dried oregano until very tender. Roast a sheet pan of halved fingerling potatoes until golden brown and tender all the way through. In a skillet, sauté a few cloves of chopped garlic. As the edges of the garlic start to color, add a splash of red wine and reduce it by about half.

Add the beans and just enough of the cooking liquid to cover them. Taste and season with salt and pepper, then top the beans with halved green olives, roughly chopped prunes and a glug of olive oil. Simmer on the stovetop for about 10 minutes. In a bowl, mix the roasted potatoes with a handful of torn parsley, chopped capers, shallots soaked in red wine vinegar, and olive oil, and scatter on top of the beans.

I used fingerlings because they’re at the farmers’ markets right now in Los Angeles, but I think that salad-y topping over the beans could just as easily have been made with browned summer squash, or roasted artichokes, or just some nice torn salad leaves and herbs.
