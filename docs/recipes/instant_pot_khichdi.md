## Description

Khichdi is a comforting and mild South Asian stew typically made with lentils and rice. This version is made with long-grain rice and yellow moong dal (or split mung beans), softened tomatoes and onion, then flavored with a cumin, coriander and turmeric, but each family has their own recipe. To bulk it up, you could add some grated carrot or zucchini with the onion, or wilt baby spinach in at the end. But topped with a drizzle of ghee, some plain yogurt and fresh cilantro, it’s a warming, homey meal just as it is.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

- .5 cup petit yellow moong dal (split lentils)
- .5 cup long-grain white rice
- 2 tablespoons ghee, plus more melted ghee for drizzling
- 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped (about .75 cup)
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger
- 1.5 teaspoons cumin seeds
- 1.5 teaspoons coriander seeds
- .5 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 2 small plum tomatoes, chopped
- Kosher salt
- Yogurt and cilantro, for serving

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, combine the dal and rice. Add water until covered.
2. Set the electric pressure cooker to sauté and melt 2 tablespoons ghee. Add the onion, ginger, cumin, coriander and turmeric to the pressure cooker and cook, stirring often, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Season with 2 teaspoons salt.
4. Drain the dal mixture and add it to the pressure cooker. Add 4 cups water, cover, and set the electric pressure cooker for 15 minutes on low pressure. It will take a couple of minutes for it to come to pressure.
5. When the time is up, immediately release the pressure. Carefully open the lid and season to taste with salt.
6. Divide among bowls. Drizzle with ghee, then top with yogurt and cilantro to serve.
