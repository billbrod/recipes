## Description

Puntarelle Salad With Anchovy and Garlic Dressing

In this classic Roman dish, crisp, juicy shreds of puntarelle are tossed with a potent anchovy- and garlic-heavy dressing. 

### Why It Works

- Crisp, bitter puntarelle pairs well with anchovies and garlic, mellowing their intense flavor. 
- If puntarelle is hard to find, endive is a great substitute. 
- Soaking thinly-sliced strips of puntarelle or endive in ice water for a few hours forms spiraled curlicues. 

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

- 20 ounces (570g) puntarelle (1 to 2 heads) or Belgian endive (8 to 10 heads; a mix of white and red if available), trimmed (see note)
- 8 oil-packed anchovies, drained (32g)
- 2 medium garlic cloves (10g)
- .5 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste; for table salt, use half as much by volume
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) red wine vinegar
- 5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- .5 cup (20g) fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 3 tablespoons (45g) capers, drained and roughly chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Pluck the outer leaves off the heads of puntarelle, tear or cut into bite-sized pieces, and set aside. Remove the shoots from the heads and, if present, trim and discard the woody bottom end of each. Cut shoots into 1/4-inch-thick strips (you may need to halve or quarter them lengthwise first). If there’s a fatter core, trim off the tougher base, cut it in half lengthwise, and then cut the halves into strips.
2. Alternatively, if using endive, quarter endive lengthwise without removing cores. Slice each quarter into 1/8-inch strips lengthwise, at an angle through core, so leaves remain attached.
3. Transfer prepared puntarelle or endive to a bowl and cover fully with cold water and a handful of ice cubes. Cover with a small plate or other similar object to keep pieces submerged. Refrigerate until curled, at least 2 hours (they may remain submerged for up to 18 hours). 
4. Drain puntarelle or endive and dry in a salad spinner. Refrigerate until needed.
5. Meanwhile, place anchovies, garlic, and salt on a cutting board and mash with the back of a fork until a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add vinegar and whisk until uniform. Add oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until emulsified.
6. Add puntarelle or endive, parsley, and half of the capers to bowl and toss to coat with dressing. Season with pepper and salt to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, top with remaining capers, and serve.
