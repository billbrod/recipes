## Ingredients { #ingredients }

- 5-6 cups mixed color cauliflower florets (white, violet, gold and green), separated and cut into pieces if necessary
- 1.25 cup mixed olives, pitted (I used Kalamata, Castelvetrano, and Mount Athos)
- 10 large cloves garlic, unpeeled
- 4 wedges preserved lemon with pulp (about .5 preserved lemon)
- Olive oil
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped, for garnish

## Directions

1. Set the oven to 450 degrees.  Cover the bottom of a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.   Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, drizzle the cauliflower florets with olive oil and toss so that they are lightly coated.  Arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet.
3. Add the olives, preserved lemon wedges and unpeeled garlic cloves to the bowl and coat with olive oil.  Tuck them amongst the cauliflower pieces.
4. Roast the ingredients in the oven for 12 minutes, just until the undersides of the cauliflower pieces are slightly browned. Turn the florets and roast for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the cauliflower is lightly cooked all the way through. Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
5. Remove the garlic cloves and preserved lemon from the baking sheet and set aside. Put the cauliflower and olives in a large serving bowl.
6. Gently squeeze the garlic cloves from their husks, taking care to keep them whole, and add to the bowl.  Remove the pulp from the preserved lemon wedges and finely chop the peel before adding it to the bowl.  Add a little more olive oil, sea salt and black pepper to taste, and toss well so that all the seasonings are evenly distributed.
7. Sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving.
