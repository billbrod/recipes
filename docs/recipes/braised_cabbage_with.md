## Description

We often talk about the braised eel and cabbage we ate in Comacchio, Italy, and wanted to include that recipe in this book. But we wondered, Where in the hell are people going to get eel? Mashama is like the MacGyver of cooks, so she decided that we’d give you a recipe that mimics the flavors of that dish with ingredients that are a lot easier to find. —John O. Morisano

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

- .5 c extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lg yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 6 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 head Savoy cabbage, shredded
- 1 (28-ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes
- Kosher salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- .25 c Colatura di Alici fish sauce (you can buy it online)

## Directions

1. In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat and then add the onion and garlic. Cook for 4 minutes.
2. Add the cabbage and tomatoes to the pan, crushing each tomato with your hand. Dump the tomato liquid from the can into the pan as well, season with salt and pepper, cover, and braise for 30 minutes.
3. Stir the paprika into the cabbage mixture. Remove from the heat and stir in the fish sauce. Transfer to a serving bowl and have at it.
