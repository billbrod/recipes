## Description
Sujuk and eggs is a hearty breakfast that is perfect for weekends and brunches. Inspired by the Turkish Suçuk Yumurta, this simple dish is packed with flavors that everyone will enjoy. 

## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- 4 eggs
- 1 sujuk, approx. 125 g / 4.5 oz
- 1 onion yellow, medium
- 1 tomato medium
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Pinch pepper
- Parsley for garnish

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Cut the sujuk into slices (8-10 slices per piece). Finely chop the tomato and onion.
2. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Add the sujuk slices into the hot pan (no oil required) and fry for 1-2 minutes. Then flip them around.
3. Add the diced onion and tomato to the pan. Fry them in the oil that the sujuk has released (they will adopt the flavor of the sausage and you won’t have to add any additional oil). Fry for another 2-3 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, crack the eggs and add them to a bowl. Whisk until the yolk and whites are combined. Season with salt and pepper. Then pour the egg mixture into the pan.
5. Stir to combine the sujuk, tomatoes, onions and eggs. Fry for 3-4 minutes. You can scramble the eggs with a wooden spoon.
6. Serve the sujuk and eggs in the pan or transfer to a plate. Garnish with finely chopped parsley or green onions (scallions). Serve with pita bread and mezze of your choice.
