## Description
Sheet pan dinners have so much promise: an entire meal prepped in one swoop, roasted and caramelized hands-free—all with just one pan to clean. But many cook unevenly or turn out sleepy and one-note in their haste. Not here: This recipe—created by To Asia, With Love author Hetty McKinnon—is the most flavorful, joyfully textured sheet-pan dinner I’ve ever made, thanks to hardworking ingredients, brilliantly paired by Hetty. Ready-to-rumble packaged Italian gnocchi form the toasty-chewy base, the hot umami pop of Chinese chili crisp takes care of the seasoning, and a scallion sour cream brightens it all.

A few more tips: Gnocchi packages vary—if you end up with slightly more than this, feel free to add it to the pan, or save it to crisp up for a quick meal later in the week. This meal doesn’t really need anything else, but it is great with cold beer or seltzer and cucumber wedges to dunk in the scallion sour cream.
## Ingredients { #ingredients }

<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->

### Gnocchi
- 1 pound (450g) baby bok choy (about 4)
- 1 to 2 bunches scallions
- 28 ounces (795g) shelf-stable, frozen, or fresh gnocchi (about 4 cups)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 to 3 tablespoons chili crisp, such as Fly By Jing brand, divided
- .5 teaspoon fine sea salt, divided
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds
- .5 small lime or lemon, for serving

### Scallion Sour Cream
- .75 cup (175ml) sour cream
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- .25 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Get ready to roast: Heat the oven to 400°F (200°C) with an oven rack positioned in the lower third. Rinse the bok choy well and, on a large cutting board with a chef’s knife, slice them lengthwise into halves or quarters—aim for something that looks roughly like the photo above. Rinse and trim the tops and bottoms of the scallions. Finely slice *3*{.ingredient-num} and set them aside for the scallion sour cream and garnish. Cut the rest of the scallions in 2-inch (5cm) lengths and set aside with the bok choy.
2. Roast the gnocchi: To a sheet pan, add the gnocchi, breaking up any clumps, plus the olive oil, *1*{.ingredient-num} to *2*{.ingredient-num} tablespoons well-stirred chili crisp (according to your spice tolerance), *.25*{.ingredient-num} teaspoon of the salt, and a good turn of black pepper. Toss with a wooden spoon to coat the gnocchi, set the pan in the lower third of the oven, and roast for 15 minutes.
3. Make the scallion sour cream: In a small bowl, whisk together about two-thirds of the finely sliced scallions, the sour cream, olive oil, salt, and lime juice. If the cream isn’t thin enough to drizzle, stir in a tablespoon of water at a time until it is.
4. Add the greens: In a large bowl or tray, stir together the baby bok choy, 2-inch (5cm) scallions, sesame oil, the remaining tablespoon of chili crisp, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt.
5. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the oven with oven mitts, carefully stir in the greens, and even everything out to a single layer. Return to the oven until the white bulbs of the baby bok choy are tender when you slide in a fork and the gnocchi are golden underneath, another 10 minutes or so.
6. Eat: Drizzle with the scallion sour cream, scatter with the remaining finely sliced scallions and sesame seeds, and serve with half a lime to squeeze over top.

## Notes

<!-- Delete section if no additional notes -->

To store: Leftover gnocchi and sauce keep well in separate sealed containers in the refrigerator for a few days. Crisp up leftover gnocchi in a little olive oil in a nonstick or cast-iron skillet.
