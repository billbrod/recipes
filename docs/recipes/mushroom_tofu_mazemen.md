## Description
Mazemen, sometimes known as mazesoba or abura soba, is a brothless ramen dish believed to have originated in Nagoya, Japan. Inspired by a punchier and spicier Taiwanese flavor profile, the soup is replaced with an intensely savory sauce. In this vegan take, this sesame paste-based sauce delivers a rich finish, bolstered with umami agents such as miso, soy sauce and chile crisp. Mazemen, which translates to mixed noodles in Japanese, should be tossed before eating, so that the sauce and the toppings distribute evenly through the noodles. While this recipe is vegan, an egg yolk or an onsen tamago (soft-cooked egg) is a common mazemen topping, which falls apart as it is tossed through the noodles, leaving a silky and creamy finish.

## Ingredients { #ingredients }


<!-- Decimals are allowed, fractions are not. For ranges, use only a single dash
and no spaces between the numbers. -->
- Canola or vegetable oil
- 8 ounces mushrooms (such as cremini, button or shiitake), sliced
- Salt and pepper
- 1 (14- to 16-ounce) package extrafirm tofu, drained and crumbled into ½-inch chunks
- 4 baby bok choy (about 12 ounces), each trimmed and cut into 4 pieces through the stem
- 12 ounces dried ramen noodles
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced

### For the Sauce

- .25 cup Chinese or Japanese sesame paste, or tahini
- 8 teaspoons chile crisp
- 4 teaspoons white (shiro) miso paste
- 4 teaspoons soy sauce
- Just-boiled water

## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->
1. Prepare the mazemen: Heat a large skillet on medium-high. When hot, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil, along with the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the mushrooms have softened, with golden edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the pan.
2. Drizzle the pan with another 2 tablespoons of oil, add the tofu and cook over medium-high, tossing occasionally, until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. (The tofu will break up more as you toss it, which is fine.)
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the baby bok boy and cook for 1½ to 2 minutes, until the stems are just tender and the leaves are bright green. Using tongs, remove the greens from the water and place in a colander.
4. To the same pot of water, add the ramen noodles and cook according to packet instructions, until just tender.
5. Meanwhile make the sauce: In a large bowl, add the sesame paste, chile crisp, miso paste, soy sauce and ½ cup just-boiled water; whisk to combine.
6. Drain the noodles. Add them to the sauce and, using tongs or chopsticks, toss everything together until the noodles are coated. (If the sauce is very thick, add another tablespoon or two of just-boiled water to help loosen up the noodles.)
7. Divide the noodles evenly among serving bowls and top each with the baby bok choy, mushrooms and tofu. Top with scallions, toss everything together and serve immediately.

## Comments

- 2026-02-18: very good, made with soba instead of ramen, and sauteed cabbage instead of bok choy, tossing together with the tofu.
