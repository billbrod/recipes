## Directions

<!-- If you have a direction that refers to a number of some ingredient, wrap
the number in asterisks and add `{.ingredient-num}` afterwards. For example,
write `Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan` as `Add *2*{.ingredient-num} to pan`. This allows
us to properly change the number when changing the serves value. -->

1. Set aside .25 cup of stock for later use.
2. Add remaining 7.75 cups stock, mushrooms, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger and
   chili garlic sauce to large stock pot, and stir to combine. Heat over
   medium-high heat until sou preaches a simmer.
3. While soup is heating, whisk together set-aside stock with cornstarch in
   small bowl until completely smooth.
4. Once soup has reached a siimer, stir in cornstarch mixture and stir for 1
   minute or so until the soup has thickened.
5. Continue stirring sou pin circular motion, then drizzle in eggs in a thin
   stream (while stirring) to create egg ribbons. Stir in tofu, half of the
   scallions, and sesame oil.

   vinegar, or more chili garlic sauce.
7. Serve immediately, garnished with extra green onions.

## Notes

<!-- Delete section if no additional notes -->

- Bobby always adds a good amount of vinegar / chili garlic sauce to taste at
  the end.
- Typically just uses 14oz of tofu, since that's what they come in.
